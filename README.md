# WEBBROWSER_INTEGRATION_WITH_DOCKER

Docker container allows an application to be packed
together with its dependencies into a portable virtual
package that can run with multi-platform support,
isolation, and resource limits applied. It will be more
reliable for the developer to build an deploy applications
if we use the docker and kubernetes in the web browser.This is 
achieved by integrating Docker with Javascript and Python CGI
